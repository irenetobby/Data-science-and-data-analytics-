            4)Testing
            5)Customer delivery/deployment
Methods in software development:
1)Waterfall method(one after the other):1)requirement analysis 2) system design 3)implementation 4)testing 5)deployment 6)maintenance
Speciality: complete each stage and move to next stage 
Demerits: 1)Tedious process 2)Can't add any change or modification to this method. 3) If the process goes on for a longer period,may be technology is changed; effort and time goes waste and have to rework.4)non-continuous releases
2)Agile methodology: Iterative approach to manage software development projects that focuses on continuous releases and incorporating customer feedback with every itr
