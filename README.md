            ii)Documentation method:Markdown file  format
            iii)Github
            iv)Cloud computing platform:google collab,kaggle
            v)Typing
            
2nd Session:Design thinking
            a)Think differently
            b)definition:Problem -solving approach focused on users
            c)Steps in problem-solving:
            i)Empathize -develop a deep understanding 
            ii)Define- articulate problem 
            iii)ideate-brainstorm 
            iv)prototype-create a dummy of the product    
            Some examples for design thinking:

3rd session:Software development
Definition: Process of designing,creating,testing & maintaining software applicationsto meet specific user needs or business objectives.
Software development lifecycle: Structured process used to design,develop & test good-quality software.
stages in software development lifecycle:
            i)Planning/requirement gathering
            ii)Design
            iii)Implementation /development
            iv)Testing
            v)Customer delivery/deployment
Methods in software development:
a)Waterfall method(one after the other):1)requirement analysis 2) system design 3)implementation 4)testing 5)deployment 6)maintenance
Speciality: complete each stage and move to next stage 
Demerits:
i)Tedious process
ii)Can't add any change or modification to this method. 
iii) If the process goes on for a longer period,may be technology is changed; effort and time goes waste and have to rework.
iv)non-continuous releases
b)Agile methodology: Iterative approach to manage software development projects that focuses on continuous releases and incorporating customer feedback with every iteration.
Increased development speed. More collaboration.Better responses to market trends.

Scrum:an agile framework for project management that helps teams deliver value through iterative cycles called "sprints". It provides a structure of roles, events, and artifacts to manage complex projects, particularly in software development, by breaking work into small, manageable chunks and allowing for continuous adaptation and improvement.

Kanban:
Kanban is a visual management method for managing work, originating from the Japanese term for "signboard". It uses a visual board to show the workflow, with tasks (often represented as cards) moving through different stages until they are completed. Key principles include visualizing the workflow, limiting work in progress, focusing on flow, and continuous improvement.

Jira is an issue-tracking and project management software from Atlassian that helps teams plan, track, and manage their work. It is widely used for agile software development and can also be used for IT service management, bug tracking, and customer support. Originally a bug-tracking tool, Jira now supports various projects through features like customizable workflows, agile boards, and issue hierarchies. Jira is a project management tool used by teams to plan, track, and manage their work. It is commonly used for bug and issue tracking, especially in software development, and for managing agile projects using features like Kanban boards and scrum sprints. Other uses include workflow automation, marketing campaign management, and program management.
