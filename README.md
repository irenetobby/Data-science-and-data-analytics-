3rd session:Software development
Definition: Process of designing,creating,testing & maintaining software applicationsto meet specific user needs or business objectives.
Software development lifecycle: Structured process used to design,develop & test good-quality software.
stages in software development lifecycle:
            i)Planning/requirement gathering
            ii)Design
            iii)Implementation /development
            iv)Testing
            v)Customer delivery/deployment
Methods in software development:
a)Waterfall method(one after the other):1)requirement analysis 2) system design 3)implementation 4)testing 5)deployment 6)maintenance
Speciality: complete each stage and move to next stage 
Demerits:
i)Tedious process
ii)Can't add any change or modification to this method. 
iii) If the process goes on for a longer period,may be technology is changed; effort and time goes waste and have to rework.
iv)non-continuous releases
b)Agile methodology: Iterative approach to manage software development projects that focuses on continuous releases and incorporating customer feedback with every iteration.
Increased development speed. More collaboration.Better responses to market trends.

Scrum:an agile framework for project management that helps teams deliver value through iterative cycles called "sprints". It provides a structure of roles, events, and artifacts to manage complex projects, particularly in software development, by breaking work into small, manageable chunks and allowing for continuous adaptation and improvement.
