Speciality: complete each stage and move to next stage 
Demerits:
i)Tedious process
ii)Can't add any change or modification to this method. 
iii) If the process goes on for a longer period,may be technology is changed; effort and time goes waste and have to rework.
iv)non-continuous releases
b)Agile methodology: Iterative approach to manage software development projects that focuses on continuous releases and incorporating customer feedback with every iteration.
Increased development speed. More collaboration.Better responses to market trends.

Kanban:
Kanban is a visual management method for managing work, originating from the Japanese term for "signboard". It uses a visual board to show the workflow, with tasks (often represented as cards) moving through different stages until they are completed. Key principles include visualizing the workflow, limiting work in progress, focusing on flow, and continuous improvement.

Jira is an issue-tracking and project management software from Atlassian that helps teams plan, track, and manage their work. It is widely used for agile software development and can also be used for IT service management, bug tracking, and customer support. Originally a bug-tracking tool, Jira now supports various projects through features like customizable workflows, agile boards, and issue hierarchies. Jira is a project management tool used by teams to plan, track, and manage their work. It is commonly used for bug and issue tracking, especially in software development, and for managing agile projects using features like Kanban boards and scrum sprints. Other uses include workflow automation, marketing campaign management, and program management.

Data analytics:
Data analytics involves analyzing raw data to extract strategic insights. For example, you might use data analytics to visualize past sales trends to make purchasing decisions.
Data science:
The science of analysing and extracting information from large sets of data, which typically combines elements of statistics, maths, computing, and other subjects.
ML:
Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computer systems to learn from data without explicit programming. In essence, it's about teaching computers to identify patterns, make decisions, and improve their accuracy over time through experience.
Ethical considerations of AI:
1)Job displacement
2)privacy concerns
3)bias & fairness:algorithmic bias,discrimination risks
4)securityissues: adversial attacks,deepfakes & misinformation
5)ethical dilemmas:autonomy & control,accountability

Python Introduction:
What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:

web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.
What can Python do?
Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
Why Python?
Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

Python Syntax:
 print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!

Python Indentation
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")
  Python Comments:
Comments can be used to explain Python code.

Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

Python Variables:

Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.
Creating Variables
Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

Python Data Types

Built-in Data Types
In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	NoneType

x = "Hello World"	str	
x = 20	int	
x = 20.5	float	
x = 1j	complex	
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]	list	
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")	tuple	
x = range(6)	range	
x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}	dict	
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}	set	
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})	frozenset	
x = True	bool	
x = b"Hello"	bytes	
x = bytearray(5)	bytearray	
x = memoryview(bytes(5))	memoryview	
x = None	NoneType	


Python Operators:

Arithmetic operators:
+	Addition	x + y	
-	Subtraction	x - y	
*	Multiplication	x * y	
/	Division	x / y	
%	Modulus	x % y	
**	Exponentiation	x ** y	
//	Floor division	x // y
Assignment operators:
=	x = 5	x = 5	
+=	x += 3	x = x + 3	
-=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	
*=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
/=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
%=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
//=	x //= 3	x = x // 3	
**=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3	
&=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	
|=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	
^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
>>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
<<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3	
:=	print(x := 3)	x = 3
print(x)	

Comparison operators:
==	Equal	x == y	
!=	Not equal	x != y	
>	Greater than	x > y	
<	Less than	x < y	
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y	

Logical operators:
and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10	
or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4	
not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)
Identity operators:
is 	Returns True if both variables are the same object	x is y	
is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y
Membership operators:
in 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	x in y	
not in	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	x not in y
Bitwise operators:
& 	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1	x & y	
|	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1	x | y	
^	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1	x ^ y	
~	NOT	Inverts all the bits	~x	
<<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off	x << 2	
>>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off	x >> 2	


a)Python Conditions and If statements:
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
  
b)The Elif Keyword
The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

The elif keyword allows you to check multiple expressions for True and execute a block of code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to True.

a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
  
  c)he Else Keyword
The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

The else statement is executed when the if condition (and any elif conditions) evaluate to False.
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")

  d)Python Loops
Python has two primitive loop commands:

while loops
for loops

The while Loop
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1

  Python For Loops
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
